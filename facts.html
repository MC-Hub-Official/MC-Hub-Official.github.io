      <h3> Lava Flowing </h3>
      <p> In the Overworld, lava flows at 50% of the speed of water. </p>

    <br />
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Paused Overworld </h3>
      <p> In Minecraft, if all the players are in the Nether, the Overworld gets paused. </p>
      <p> So crops don't grow, mobs don't move, and time doesn't pass, alongside other things. </p>
      <p> For<a class='blue'> Bedrock </a>and <a class='green'>Java</a> Edition. </p>

      <h3> Axolotl Colours </h3>
      <p> The rare blue axolotl is a reference to Pokemon: there is a blue Pokemon named Mudkip based on an axolotl. </p>
      <p> See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/j58qmi/the_blue_axolotl_a_rare_gaming_reference/"> this Reddit post</a>. </p>

    <br />
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Minceraft </h3>
      <p> Rarely, on the Minecraft in-game start screen, instead of saying 'Minecraft' it says 'Minceraft'! </p>
      <p> (There is a 1 in 10,000 chance of this happening) </p>
      <p> For<a class='blue'> Bedrock</a> Edition. </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Health Meter </h3>
      <p> Dogs have a built-in health meter! The lower the tail, the lower the health; the higher the tail, the higher the health! </p>
      <p> If the health gets too low, the dog will DIE and you will be sad. </p>

      <h3> Mob Vision </h3>
      <p> If you go into gamemode 3 (spectator) and right-click a mob, you will then get the vision of that mob. </p>
      <p> A creeper will turn the world green, and an enderman will turn the world purple. </p>
      <p> A spider will duplicate the normal vision, putting one on top of the other, squishing both halves. </p>
      <p> For <a class='green'>Java</a> Edition. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3> Bow vs Sword </h3>
      <p> A fully charged bow will do more damage than a diamond sword! </p>
      <p> If you're on the run, a dimond sword will be better because the bow takes a long time to charge up. </p>

    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Mobs in Boats </h3>
      <p> You can put friendly and hostile mobs in boats! </p>
      <p> To do this, you need to lead the mob to the boat. </p>
      <p> This helps to move mobs around. You can also trap hostile mobs in boats to kill them. </p>
      <p> For<a class= 'blue'> Bedrock </a>and <a class='green'>Java </a>Edition. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3> Potion Duration </h3>
      <p> If you splash a potion on your head, the effect will last slightly longer than if you splash anywhere else. </p>
      <p> This can be incredibly useful if you're using potions. </p>
      <p> For<a class="blue"> Bedrock </a>and <a class="green">Java </a>Edition. </p>
    </div>
    <br />

      <h3> Leaf, Leaf, Leaf! </h3>
