      <h3> MC Hub Seeds </h3>
      <p> Here is a list of some really great Minecraft loot seeds! </p>
      <p> They are mostly for Bedrock Edition, but you will find some for Java Edition too. </p>
      <p> At the bottom of the page, you will find Structure and Biome seeds, a collection of seeds that spawn you very close to the mentioned generated structure or biome. </p>
      <p> We have linked to the website where we have obtained the seeds, where applicable. </p>
      <p> Note: We will make some more Java seeds soon, we haven't got too many at the moment.</p>
