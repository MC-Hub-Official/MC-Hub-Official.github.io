      <h3> Clone </h3>
      <p> The /clone command can be used to replicate a set of blocks somewhere else! It will save you a lot of time when building a row of houses, for example. </p>
      <p> /clone [x, y, z] [x, y, z] [x, y, z] [optional:type] </p>
      <p> Example: /clone 72 64 -129 83 73 -160 ~ ~ ~ </p>
      <p> This will clone all the blocks from 72 64 -129 (the bottom back left corner) to 83 73 -160 (the top front right corner) of a 3d structure to ~ ~ ~ (where you are standing)
      <p> So the cloned structure's bottom back left corner will reappear where you were standing. You can also replace ~ ~ ~ with a set of coordinates to clone it there instead. </p>
      <p> Use "move" at the end of the command to remove the original structure but keep the duplicate. "replace" is the default. </p>
      <p> Remember, you can turn on Show Coordinates in the Settings menu if playing Bedrock edition. It may also lag a bit before it clones. <p>

      <h3> Fill </h3>
      <p> The /fill command can be used to create solid walls, cubes, or cuboids, in a matter of seconds. </p>
      <p> /fill [x, y, z] [x, y, z] [block] [optional:data] </p>
      <p> Example: /fill ~ ~ ~ 94 68 -228 wool </p>
      <p> That will create a solid wall from where you are standing to 94 68 -228 out of white wool. </p>
      <p> For wool, experiment with adding numbers from 1-16 (the number of different colours of wool) to the end to change the colour! </p>
      <p> For wood, 1-8 at the end for different types. </p>

      <h3> Give </h3>
      <p> Use /give to put items in a player's inventory. </p>
      <p> /give [player] [item] [amount] [optional:data] </p>
      <p> Example: /give @p wool 64 </p>
      <p> This will give the closest player 64 white wool. </p>
      <p> For wool, experiment with adding numbers from 1-16 (the number of different colours of wool) to the end to change the colour! </p>
      <p> For wood, 1-8 at the end for different types. </p>

      <h3> Say </h3>
      <p> The /say command is probably the easiest, and in the chat, is practically useless. </p>
      <p> /say [text] </p>
      <p> Example: /say hi guys MC Hub is a great site </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3> Setblock </h3>
      <p> The setblock command is like the fill command, except it only fills one block. </p>
      <p> /setblock [x, y, z] [block] [optional:data] </p>
      <p> So you enter the Co-ordinates of the spot where you want it, then enter the block, and if you want, the data. </p>
      <p> /setblock 1, 5, 1 wool 3 </p>
