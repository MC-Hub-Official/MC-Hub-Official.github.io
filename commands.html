      <h3> Teleport </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> The /tp command allows you to instantly teleport any entity to a set of coordinates or another entitity. </p>
      <p> Example: /tp [entity] [x, y, z / entity] </p>
      <p> Example: /tp @e[type=dolphin] MCHubSite </p>
      <p> Example: /tp MCHubSite 450 30 -2260 </p>
    </div>

      <h3> Clone </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> The /clone command can be used to replicate a set of blocks somewhere else! It will save you a lot of time when building a row of houses, for example. </p>
      <p> Example: /clone [x, y, z] [x, y, z] [x, y, z] [optional:type] </p>
      <p> Example: /clone 72 64 -129 83 73 -160 ~ ~ ~ </p>
      <p> This will clone all the blocks from 72 64 -129 (the bottom back left corner) to 83 73 -160 (the top front right corner) of a 3d structure to ~ ~ ~ (where you are standing)
      <p> So the cloned structure's bottom back left corner will reappear where you were standing. You can also replace ~ ~ ~ with a set of coordinates to clone it there instead. </p>
      <p> Use "move" at the end of the command to remove the original structure but keep the duplicate. "replace" is the default. </p>
      <p> Remember, you can turn on Show Coordinates in the Settings menu if playing Bedrock edition. It may also lag a bit before it clones. <p>

      <h3> Fill </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> The /fill command can be used to create solid walls, cubes, or cuboids, in a matter of seconds. </p>
      <p> Example: /fill [x, y, z] [x, y, z] [block] [optional:data] </p>
      <p> Example: /fill ~ ~ ~ 94 68 -228 wool </p>
      <p> That will create a solid wall from where you are standing to 94 68 -228 out of white wool. </p>
      <p> For wool, experiment with adding numbers from 1-16 (the number of different colours of wool) to the end to change the colour! </p>
      <p> For wood, 1-8 at the end for different types. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Give </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> Use /give to put items in a player's inventory. </p>
      <p> Example: /give [player] [item] [amount] [optional:data] </p>
      <p> Example: /give @p wool 64 </p>
      <p> This will give the closest player 64 white wool. </p>
      <p> For wool, experiment with adding numbers from 1-16 (the number of different colours of wool) to the end to change the colour! </p>
      <p> For wood, 1-8 at the end for different types. </p>

    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Say </h3>
      <p class="green"> Not a cheat </p>
      <p> The /say command is probably the easiest, and in the chat, is practically useless. </p>
      <p> Example: /say [text] </p>
      <p> Example: /say hi guys MC Hub is a great site </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Setblock </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> The setblock command is like the fill command, except it only sets one block. </p>
      <p> Example: /setblock [x, y, z] [block] [optional:data] </p>
      <p> So you enter the coordinates of the spot where you want it, then enter the block, and if you want, the data. </p>
      <p> Example: /setblock 1 5 1 wool 3 </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Title </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> The title command is really useful when making minigames. </p>
      <p> It allows you to select a player and show a message on the player's screen. </p>
      <p> Example: /title [player] [titletype] [titletext] </p>
      <p> You enter the player who should see the message, the title type, and the text that should appear. </p>
      <p> The title type would be either "title", "subtitle" or "actionbar". </p>
      <p> With "title", the message would cover most of the player's screen. </p>
      <p> With "subtitle", it would show a slightly smaller message below the title although you can't do just a subtitile you'll need a title as well.</p>
      <p> And with "actionbar", it would show up above your XP bar. </p>
      <p> /title MCHubSite title You win! </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3> Kill </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> The kill command will allow you to instantly kill any entity. </p>
      <p> The player kill command is /kill [player] </p>
      <p> The entity kill command is /kill [entity] </p>
      <p> Or you can kill all entities/players with /kill @e </p>
      <p> You can also choose a specific type of entity to kill with /kill @e[type=type] </p>
      <p> So to kill all silverfish, do /kill @e[type=silverfish] </p>
      <p> In Bedrock Edition, you can't kill players in Creative. </p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Gamerule </h3>
      <p class="green"> Not a cheat </p>
      <p> The gamerule commands can change the way your world works. </p>
      <p> Example: /gamerule [gamerule] [true/false] </p>

      <h3> Gamemode </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> Using /gamemode, you can change the game mode of any player. </p>
      <p> Example: /gamemode [survival:creative:adventure:spectator:default] [player] </p>
      <p> Example: /gamemode creative MCHubSite </p>
      <p> In Bedrock Edition, you can't set someone to Spectator. </p>
      <p> In Bedrock Edition, you can simply do "c" for Creative, "s" for Survival, "a" for Adventure, and "d" for the default gamemode. </p>
      <p> So: /gamemode c MCHubSite </p>
      <p> See below for an explanation of default, or "d" </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Default Gamemode </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> Similar to Gamemode (see above), except this sets the default gamemode for new players, instead of a specific player. </p>
      <p> Use /defaultgamemode instead of /gamemode, and don't include the player. </p>
      <p> You can't use default, or "d" here. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> OP and deOP </h3>
      <p class="green"> Not a cheat </p>
      <p> If you are an operator, then by using /op, you can give operator permissions to any player, and by using /deop, you can remove someone's OP status. </p>
      <p> Example: /op [player] | /deop [player] </p>
      <p> Example: /op MCHubSite | /deop this_random_noob </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Enchant </h3>
      <p class="red"> Cheat </p>
      <p> You can use /enchant to enchant the item that a player is holding. </p>
      <p> Example: /enchant [player] [enchantment] [level] </p>
      <p> Example: /enchant MCHubSite sharpness 5 </p>
      <p> So in the second example, if MCHubSite was holding a diamond sword, it would then be enchanted with Sharpness 5. </p>
      <p> Unfortunately, you can only enchant an item if you could normally put the same enchantment on it in an anvil. So you can't enchant blocks, and you can't get more than the designated level for an enchantment. </p>
