      <h3> Clone </h3>
        <p> The clone command starts, as always, with a forward slash, then clone. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>                      /clone                                            </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Then, you enter the co-ordinates of the top left corner of the structure you want to clone into the command block,
        and then the co-ordinates of the bottom right corner. eg: </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>                      /clone 0 5 0 20 10 20                             </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Then you enter the co-ordinates of where you want the bottom left corner to be. eg: </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>                      /clone 0 5 0 20 10 20 100 5 100                  </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Then you can choose what to do with the thing you want cloned. 
        -    Replace. Classic cloning. duplicates the structure.
        -    Masked. Only non-air blocks are cloned. So, you can potentially clone a hollow object so that it surrounds another object.
        -    Filtered. If selected, you must specify which blocks are not filtered. The idea here is that, after you write the command,
             you add a list of blocks separated by spaces.
             When the command is executed, only blocks of the listed type are cloned. </p>
        <p> You can add these on to the end of the statement to modify it. </p>
        <p> 
        - Move. Shifts target structuer from one point to another.
        - Force. Natural cloning, but if an object is in its way, it just clones into it. This function often rusults in an error message. eg: </p>
        <p>                     /clone 0 5 0 20 10 20 100 5 100 masked move       </p>
