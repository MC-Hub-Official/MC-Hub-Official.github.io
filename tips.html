      <h3> MC Hub Tips </h3>
      <p> Here is a selection of the best tips from the best players. </p>
      <p> These tips are mostly based on how to succeed in Survival mode, but there are some that work for Creative too! </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Starting Off </h3>
      <p> When you first start a new survival world, you should first get 5-10 logs. </p>
      <p> Then craft your logs into planks, make a crafting table and then a few sticks. </p>
      <p> Craft a wooden pickaxe and mine 15-18 cobblestone and create a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe and and a stone shovel. </p>
      <p> If you're on Bedrock Edition, craft a stone sword. Craft a furnace, and if you want to start farming, a hoe. </p>
      <p> When you have done all of this, you're good to go! </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Sustainable Food </h3>
      <p> In the early days, you should NOT kill animals and instead bring them back to your base. </p>
      <p> Breed those animals and make a wheat, vegetable, and sugar cane farm. </p>
      <p> This should keep you fed for your early days as they can be quick and easy food sources instead of killing all the animals in your area. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Finding ore </h3>
      <p> One of the best ways to find ore in Minecraft is to start a strip mine. </p>
      <p> A strip mine is a long horizontal mine at a specific Y level. </p>
      <p> For diamonds, it's best to start from Y levels 1-15. For iron, try Y level 50. </p>
      <p> For coal, level 60. And for Netherite (Ancient Debris) try levels 0-20 in the Nether. </p>
      <p> You can also find diamonds in village chests and other chests. </p>
      <p> Remember, you can find your Y level using the (F3) debug screen on Java Edition, or through the Show Coordinates option on Bedrock Edition. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Mining Down </h3>
        <p> Whenever you're mining down you should mine four block tall staircase tunnels. </p>
        <p> This prevents you from hitting your head, though you will only need 3 block tall staircase tunnels for this. </p>
        <p> The reason for the fourth block is so you can place stairs in order to run up and down in it a lot faster. </p>
        <p> This will help you move faster through mines, and reduce hunger loss. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> The fastest ways to move </h3>
      <p> In Survival, the fastest way to move is sprinting while jumping roughly every second, standing on ice with trapdoors above you. The effects of Speed help too. </p>
      <p> When on the move, avoid soul, slime and honey blocks. Crouching will slow you down too, as well as the effects of Slowness. </p>
      <p> In Creative mode, try sprinting while flying. You will go really fast. Soul Speed on boots will speed you up on soul blocks. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Never dig straight down </h3>
      <p> Never dig straight down in Survival. There are many lava lakes and mob-filled caves you could fall into. </p>
      <p> If you absolutely have to, stand in the middle of two blocks, mine one, then the other, in alternate patterns. </p>
      <p> This will allow you to see what's below you before you fall in. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Bring water buckets to the End </h3>
      <p> You can use them to surround yourself in water when endermen are attacking you. </p>
      <p> Endermen are allergic to water so they will not be able to get to you. </p>
      <p> You can also use them to break your fall off an obsidian pillar. </p>
      <p> You can also use Feather Falling on boots to break your fall, but you will still take some damage. </p>
      <p> It's best to have a water bucket in your hotbar all the time, even not in the end. This will help you break your fall and save your life in lava.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Place bookshelves around your enchantment table </h3>
      <p> You can put 15 bookshelves in a 1-block high wall around your table to make it look especially nice, leaving a 1-block gap to get in. </p>
      <p> This will greatly enchance the power of the table and give you much better enchantments. </p>
      <p> There are many other bookshelf formations that will look equally good - or nicer. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3> Always wear golden armour to the Nether </h3>
      <p> Always wear at least one piece of golden armour when entering the Nether. </p>
      <p> Piglins do not attack you when you wear golden armour unless you attack them or mine nearby Nether Gold. </p>
      <img class="image" src="https://exf.minecraft-hub.com/images/Always wear golden armour to the Nether.png"></img>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Use ยง (section sign) </h3>
      <p> If you use ยง followed by a specific letter or number in a command or in the chat, it will make whatever you are writing colorful! </p>
      <p> a = green, b = blue, c = red, d = purple, e = yellow, f = white, to name a few. <p> 
      <p> Not all characters work! </p>
      <p> In Java Edition 1.16+, using plugins (or way too many commands), you can also use custom HEX colour codes. Many plugins support this with the ยงx code. </p>
      <p> Using this is in mostly only a Bedrock Edition feature, although it will work in some places (like server MOTDs) on Java Edition. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Critical Hits </h3>
      <p> To deal the most damge to your enemy, jump, and while falling, hit. This deals more damage, called a critical hit, also known as a "crit". </p>
      <p> It only works while you are falling. </p>
      <p> If you're attacking the Ender Dragon, keep in mind that attacking the head does more damage than to the body. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Furnace Variants </h3>
      <p> In order to smelt/cook items at double the speed, there are different furnace variants. </p>
      <p> Use a blast furnace to smelt ores faster, and a smoker to cook food faster. </p>
      <p> Cook unlimited food with no fuel on a campfire (or soul campfire)! Tap or right click on it while holding food. </p>
      <p> Blast furnaces and smokers may be faster, but they use twice the amount of fuel! </p>
      <img class="image" src="https://exf.minecraft-hub.com/images/Furnace Variants.png"></img>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Lawn Mower </h3>
      <p> If you want to clear tall grass and flowers from a section of land, place water in the middle of the area. </p>
      <p> This will break all of the vegetation it comes into contact with. </p>
      <p> However, the water can get annoying and you will have to pick up the water on the exact water source block. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
     <div class="section">
       <h3> Yummy! </h3>
       <p> The best way to harvest food from an animal, is to first set it on fire, then kill it before the fire burns out. </p>
       <p> This will drop cooked food automatically, and it saves a lot of cooking time. </p>
       <p> To get the most out of a vegetable crop, convert it into it's cooked form, such as baked potatoes, from potatoes. </p>
       <p> Usually this means to use a furnace, but some food recipes are in a crafting table as well.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Yummy? </h3>
      <p> When you're starving and hurt, try rotten flesh if there is no other option. </p>
      <p> Sometimes rotten flesh does not give you hunger, and even if it does, just stay still until it wears off. </p>
      <p> You will be left with almost full hunger. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Rainy Fish? </h3>
      <p> When you're fishing, always remember to try and fish in the rain, </p>
      <p> because fish are more common when it is raining. </p>
      <img class="image" src="https://exf.minecraft-hub.com/images/Rainy Fish%3F.png"></img>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Ice Ice Baby </h3>
      <p> All types of spiders can't climb ice! </p>
      <p> This can be useful when building a spider-proof wall without using extra blocks for an overhang. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Emerald Farming </h3>
      <p> A quick and easy way to earn emeralds is trade with a fletcher. </p>
      <p> The reason to trade with a fletcher rather than another villager is that you can trade sticks with a fletcher. </p>
      <p> This is a quick and easy way to earn emeralds. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Suspicious Stew </h3>
      <h4> How to get it in Creative mode: </h4>
      <p> This is a food item that cannot be found in a creative inventory. </p>
      <p> However, you can obtain it using the /give command (find out on <a href="/commands">our Commands page</a>). </p>
      <h4> How to get it in Survival mode: </h4>
      <p> To craft, arrange a mushroom soup in your crafting grid. </p>
      <p> Then add a flower underneath the brown mushroom. </p>
      <p> You now have a suspicious stew! </p>
      <p> It can also be obtained in shipwrecks. </p>
      <p> Note: You cannot craft this stew in Bedrock Edition. </p>
      <h4> What it does: </h4>
      <p> Suspicious stew applies an effect for 0.3-12 seconds. </p>
      <p> The effect changes depending on the flower you use. </p>
      <p> The only way to know what effect it has is when you craft it, otherwise the effect will be random. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="section">
      <h3> Turtle Master </h3>
      <p> The turtle master potion applies resistance III and slowness IV. </p>
      <p> It makes the applied entity invincible, although incredibly slow. </p>
      <p> This effect can be applied to a tipped arrow. </p>
