      <h3> The fastest ways to move </h3>
      <p> In Survival, the fastest way to move is sprinting while jumping roughly every second. The effects of Speed help too. </p>
      <p> In Creative mode, try sprinting while flying. You go really fast. </p>
      <p> When on the move, avoid Soul Sand, Soul Soil and crouching. Slime and Honey blocks slow you down too. </p>

      <h3> Never mine straight down </h3>
      <p> Never mine straight down in Survival. There are many lava lakes and mob-filled caves you could fall into. </p>
      <p> If you absolutely have to, stand in the middle of two blocks, mine one, then the other, in alternate patterns. </p>
      <p> This will allow you to see what's below you before you fall in. </p>
